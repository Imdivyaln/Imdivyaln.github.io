Hey! I’m Divya

I am from Bangalore, India. I have been looking for an outlet to  be creative, which brings me here. I will be posting all of my travel adventures, lifestyle, fashion and all trendy stuff here. I would like to keep my posts short and interesting. 

I would like to keep my posts informative, so the travel posts will always have a “ things to explore” section, which will list the top things to do at that particular destination along with related website links, prices, etc.

My fashion blog will also have some trendy outfits and accessories along with information on where to find them online.

I am also a foodie, so there will also be a few food blogs on some scrumptious food and drinks.

The goal of this blog is to share my experiences which may help a few of you either in your future trips or in buying fashion apparels.
