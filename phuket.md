Thailand has some very exotic, beautiful and mesmerizing places like Phi Phi Island, Chiang Mai, Pattaya, and Phuket, because of which I always had Thailand on my list of must visit places. Earlier this year a couple of my friends and I decided to visit Thailand. Bangkok and Phuket were the two places we decided upon for the one week vacation.

Phuket is Thailand’s largest island and it is among the most popular places for travelers heading to South East Asian countries. Phuket is a reinforested, Tropical Island, which is known for its clear water beaches. The island has an unexpected and drastic weather changes all the time. During the “high season” most of the days are expected to be sunny; however,  the weather is very volatile. One minute it’s scorching, the next minute it’s raining cats and dogs. We went in August; luckily there were only a few showers.

### Day 1 

We reached Phuket at eleven in the morning; from the airport, we took a minivan to the hotel. We had booked our accommodation in the [Secret Cliff Resort](https://www.phuketsecretcliff.com/) which is located on the cliff slopes of Karon. The property is serene and surrounded by ocean and trees, along with this; it also provides a spectacular view of the Andaman Sea.  Our room was strategically located on the property, which gave us a breathtaking and mesmerizing view of the ocean. After looking around the property for some time, we had a quick lunch in the restaurant, which also had a awesome view. After a break we went into the pool which had an open-ended edge from where the sea could be seen, it was truly spectacular. Later in the night we went for a stroll to the Karon main street and had our dinner, after which we called it a day.


### Day 2

Next day we woke up surrounded by the amazing ocean view, we chilled out in the pool for some time after our Thai breakfast, which had a widespread of most delicious and appetizing snacks, eggs and fruits. Later in the day, we checked out of the secret cliff, as we had booked our stay in an Airbnb called [The Deck](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18067331?source_impression_id=p3_1602458020_uLceeg07rAgtHl9L), which is located near the Patong. After checking into the new stay, we took a grab (Taxi like Uber) and started visiting some close by scenic locations. Firstly we went to Promthep Cape, which is the islands most photographed viewpoint. After spending some quality time at the picturesque cape, we went to the Windmill Viewpoint. On the way back, we found the  Nai Harn beach, we had heard a lot about the place, but we could not make it due to lack of time. It was almost dark by the time we returned, so we went to a nearby Pizzeria for dinner. After the dinner, we strolled through the Bangla Street for some time and then went to bed.


### Final Day

PS: On the third and fourth day, we were on an island tour, about which I will talk in my next blog.

The Previous evening we went to Illuzion, which is the most visited and impressive night spots on the island of Phuket. We spent a good 4 to 5 hours there, which went well past the midnight. It was early in the morning when we returned, so we were very tired and sleepy. We woke up late in the afternoon and decided to visit the Big Buddha. The huge image of Buddha sits on top of the Nakkerd Hills between Chalong and the Kata. The 45-meter tall monument can be seen from as far away as the Karon Beach. After a brief visit to the Big Buddha, we headed back to the Patong beach, rested there for a while and had some mouthwatering street food. After some delectable food, we headed to full moon brew works, which is located in the Jungceylon mall. After a couple of drinks, we had a comforting foot massage.
