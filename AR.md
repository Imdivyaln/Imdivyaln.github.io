## Autonomous Robots 

Learning enabled components (LECs) trained using data-driven algorithms are increasingly being used to achieve autonomy related perception and control tasks like end-to-end driving, object detection and tracking, and image segmentation. In this area, we have designed small scale remote controlled car called DeepNNCAR to autonomously drive around a track in our lab using the popular NVIDIA's DAVE-II neural network model.
