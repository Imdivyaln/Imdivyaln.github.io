In the five days we were in Phuket, we visited two nearby islands. Trips to the surrounding islands are a must thing to do when in Phuket, so please put this in your bucket list of things to do in Phuket. Due to the short trip, we were on, we chose to visit two of the most visited islands. I was truly mesmerized by the shiny turquoise ocean, dozens of islands, natural sea caves, natural rock formations, green vegetation, and the magical bays. The two-day visit to the islands was my most enjoyable time; it made me feel like in heaven.   

Trips to the island of your choice can be booked online or anywhere in Phuket. They are very popular and hence can find agents booking it through your hotel, street booths or even on the beach. There are different trip packages and prices, so look at the differences in these packages before paying for them. The difference is usually in terms of the number of islands that are included, the length of the trip, the number of people on the boat and the type of the boat. Some of these packages include food and snacks throughout the trip, look out for it before selection.


### Phi Phi Island Tour

On the first day of the two-day trip we opted for visiting the Phi Phi Island. The package included picking and dropping services from the hotel to the pier, where we also had complimentary drinks and snack. After a quick snack time we left from there towards the island in a speedboat, it was about a 1hour ride. Firstly we had the sightseeing of the Maya Bay, the Loh Sama bay, the Pileh lagoon, and the Viking Cave. After the brief sightseeing, we had a stop at the Phi Phi Don island for lunch and we spent some time there. Later we left to the Khai Island where we did snorkeling for some time. After all the time we spent on the island we left back to Phuket in the evening.

### James Bond Island Tour

Next day we went to the James bond island. This was the best day for me on the entire trip; I just enjoyed the island trip a lot. Even this package included the pickup and drop services along with food and drinks. Firstly we went to the Panak Island and spent some time canoeing/kayaking from the boat to Mangrove lagoon/bat cave, this was amazing and insanely beautiful. Later we had another stop at the Hong Island and once again we had some time to explore the blue and tranquil lagoon. The best part of these trips to the lagoon is the canoe, it is fun to be on it. Then we headed to the Na care island, where we were allowed to kayak by ourselves, it was a fun experience. Our last stop was the James Bond Island, we explored the island for 30 minutes and then returned back to Phuket later in the evening.
